        <p>Welcome to <u>Ghost Towns and Abandoned Places of America</u>!<br><br>This site contains a collection of hundreds of
        ghost towns and derelict locations from across the US, from the mining towns of the Western states
        to the ruins of sea forts in Florida and Georgia. Each location is showcased with the most recent 
        photos available (as well as a few old ones) and as much information as could be found using other ghost town sites, as well as 
        Wikipedia. Coordinates and maps, via Google Maps, are included as well because visiting in person is 
        a great way to experience a location's history firsthand. If you are planning to visit an abandoned 
        location, remember the core rules of ghost towning:<br><br> 1. <u>Be Prepared!</u> Check the weather ahead of time and 
        bring appropriate clothing and gear 
        to safely explore. For longer visits, pack adequate food and water, especially in very hot or cold 
        environments; and don't forget your camera!<br>2. <u>Be Safe!</u> Be aware of any and all hazards (ie. 
        rusty metal, vertical mine portals, chemicals). Stay Out, Stay Alive. Do not take any unnecessary risks.<br>3. <u>Be Legal!</u> 
        Respect private property (some locations require scheduled visits), and do not remove artifacts or even dirt from the location. Take only pictures and 
        memories.<br>4. <u>Be Informed!</u> It is well worth it to take the time to acquire information on the location you wish to visit. The stories and 
        layout of the location will be more easily understood, and your visit will generally yield a 
        greater experience.<br><br></p>
